# import-cost-atom package

A (probably rough) port of [Wix's import-cost for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/wix/import-cost).

## Known Issues

Due to `import-cost` requiring a native module, when you first use the plugin you'll have to rebuild. Not sure how to get around that one, sorry!

## Develop

To load a local develop branch, clone the repository and link via symlink in `~/.atom/packages`.
